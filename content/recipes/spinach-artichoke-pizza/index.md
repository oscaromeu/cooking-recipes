- ‚è≤Ô∏è  Prep time: 15 min 
- üç≥ Cook time: 15 min 
- üç¥ Servings: 8 

## Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons salted butter
- 3 cloves garlic, finely chopped
- 1 teaspoon dried basil
- 1 teaspoon dried oregano
- 1/2 teaspoon dried thyme
- 1/2 teaspoon crushed fennel seed
- 1 pinch red pepper flakes use to taste
- 1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil
- 1 pinch each kosher salt and black pepper
- 16 ounces fresh baby spinach
- 1 cup whole milk mozzarella, cubed
- 1/2 pound pizza dough, homemade or store-bought
- 1 cup shredded fontina, gouda, or mozzarella cheese
- 1/3 cup grated parmesan
- 1 (8 ounce) jar marinated artichokes, drained

## Directions 

1. Position the oven rack in the upper 1/3 portion of your oven. Preheat the oven to 500¬∞ F. for at least 30 minutes before baking, preferably 1-2 hours ahead. If you have a baking stone, start preheating it.
2. In a skillet, melt together the butter, basil, oregano, thyme, fennel, and red pepper flakes. Cook until the garlic is golden and crisp, 3-4 minutes. Pour the garlic butter out of the skillet and set aside.
3. Set the same skillet over medium heat. Add the olive oil, baby spinach, and a pinch each of salt and pepper. Cook 5 minutes, until the spinach is wilted, make sure to get all the excess water out.
4.  On a lightly floured surface, push/roll the pizza dough out until it is pretty thin (about a 12-14 inch circle). Place the pizza dough on a lightly oiled sheet pan. Arrange the cubed mozzarella around the edge of the dough. Fold the edges of the dough over the cheese, pinching to seal the cheese inside.
5. Spread on the garlic butter, then the spinach. Sprinkle on the shredded cheese and parmesan. Toss the artichokes with a drizzle of olive oil, then arrange them over the pizza.
6. Slide into the preheated oven and bake for 10 minutes, rotate the pizza, and bake another 3-5 minutes or until the crust is golden and the cheese has melted. Top the pizza with fresh basil. ENJOY!
