# Cilantro Rice

{{< postimage "images/recipe_image.jpg" "" >}}

Borrowing from the fresh flavors of arroz verde and reminiscent of Chipotle‚Äôs cilantro-lime rice, this simple dish is a low-effort, high-reward accompaniment to all good things, such as pork chops and crispy tofu. Though diced fresh onion could season the rice, onion powder is a savory bedrock with its concentration of umami, especially once bloomed in oil. This aromatic dish plays to the strengths of the cilantro plant: The stems cook with the rice, lending their peppery brightness, and the tender leaves confetti the dish for a final viridescent flourish.

- ‚è≤Ô∏è  Prep time: 10 
- üç≥ Cook time: 25
- üç¥ Servings: 4

## Ingredients

- 1 tablespoon unsalted butter
- 1 tablespoon vegetable oil
- 1 tablespoon onion powder
- 1 bunch cilantro, stems and leaves separated, both finely chopped 
- 1 cup long-grain white rice, such as jasmine or basmati
- ¬Ω teaspoon kosher salt (Diamond Crystal), plus more to taste
- 1 large jalape√±o, thinly sliced
-  Juice of 1/2 lime, plus more to taste

## Directions 

1. Melt the butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Add the oil, then stir in the onion powder and cilantro stems until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add the rice and stir until oil-slicked, just a few seconds. 

2. Add 1 1/2 cups water, raise the heat to high and bring to a simmer. Reduce the heat to low, cover the saucepan and cook until all of the water is absorbed, 17 to 20 minutes. Remove from the heat and let the rice sit, covered, to steam for 10 more minutes.

3. Fold in the salt, cilantro leaves, jalape√±o and lime juice. Taste for seasoning, adding more salt and lime juice as desired.
