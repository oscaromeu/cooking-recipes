# üç≤ Cooking Recipes üç≥

This project is heavily inspired by [based.cooking](https://www.based.cooking) 
the main difference besides from the tools used is that this is for personal usage only. 

The idea is to have a place to store all my recipes and make easy to check them
when I need. Also, I liked the idea of having a cooking recipes web page without 
bloated web design and full of annoying ads or trackers. For now this is deployed
with github pages [cooking-recipes](https://oscaromeu.github.io/cooking-recipes/)
but the goal is to provision this service in my private cloud XD.
